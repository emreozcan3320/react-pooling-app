## Development Notes

When I was writing this application, I  learned significant things and If I write it again, I will definitely write **differently.**

There are decisions you should take before writing code and I confess, I made some mistakes at this stage.  
But the main problem I had not enough time to finish the project because of job-related things. 
Although, It is not an excuse but a fact so I had to work very efficiently. So I searched for similar apps on the internet however I found a few and they are too **old**or **not similar** to the application in my mind although I opened their source code and looked up how they structured their application and I liked some of them.

After this step, I read some **medium posts**, searched the **best practice** of reactjs and **common mistakes ** done by the developers. As a result, I had some ideas in my mind. 
As addition, I used **react docs** a lot at the beginning of development for recent best practices and  I used **```react-bootstrap```**  docs a lot at the end for  **responsive design**  by the way react-bootstrap documentation is very good when I compare it **angular material design** docs.

Before the starting to write code, I decided on the **application structure** or we can call it **application flow**. 
So I draw the application pages and decided what should be a **view** , what should be a **component** and which react concepts I could apply for the problems. 
On the other hand, I knew  I need more but for now, I kept it **simple** and didn't want to** overkill** the application with all the **popular react stuff**.

Some mistake I made in this application are;
- Not effectively using ```Context.api``` 
- Some components got bigger than I anticipated when I add bootstrap
- Not separated component and views at the most efficient way
- and I am not sure the way I am using  ```fectch```
